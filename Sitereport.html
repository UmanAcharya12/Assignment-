	<h1>Module Expereince</h1><hr>
	<p>The development and design of a basic web page can be a fun yet tricky task. Whether it's a large comercial web page for business purpose, or a small personal portfolio web page; the proces of development is the same. The three major steps leading to the development and design of a basic web page include: information gathering, site layout and design, and HTML conversion.<br><br> There were lots of ups and downs in my work too. Especially the height and width of the page gave me some trouble during the development of my personal web page. Choosing colors were way intresting than other tasks for fonts, rows and  columns. Hyperlinks were used to jump from one page to the other.</p>
